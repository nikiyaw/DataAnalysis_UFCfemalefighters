# Data Analysis, UFC Female Fighter Satistics

## Overview
The goal of this project is to perform an in-dept EDA and study the statistics for all the UFC female fighters, which includes evaluating individual basic fighting metrics and all of the fight histories. 

## Tools and Programming Language(s)
Jupyter Notebook, Python, Excel Dashboard

## Process
1. Obtain the datasets from Kaggle.
2. Perform data cleaning and data wrangling to obtain relevant data. (Both datasets include all fighters, both male and female)
3. Conduct EDA on both clean datasets to uncover trends and insights.
4. Rank the fighters in weightclasses based on 3 main fighting strategies: striking, grappling and defense.
5. Build an interactive dashboard to present and compare the basic fighting metrics for the chosen fighters. 

## Results
Out of the 3 main ifghting strategies, grappling seems to play a huge role in determining if a fighter will win the fight. 

### Challenges
There are a lot of technical terms being used in the dataset, especially in the dataset that listed all the fight histories. It is time consuming, trying to figure out what those terms indicate and how it fits in the data analysis portion of the project. 

### Future Goals
There are still tons of directions we can go from here. For example, really dive into the weightclasses and see if there are differences between fighting strategies.
